5. **Data Pruning and Archiving:**
	- For historical datasets, implementing data pruning and archiving strategies is essential. This ensures that only relevant and current data is part of analytical processes, preventing unnecessary load on the system.
6. **Incremental Data Loading - external systems**
	- Implementing mechanisms for incremental data loading reduces the amount of data processed during each analytics cycle. This is particularly effective when dealing with large datasets that don't change frequently.
- Lessons Learned:
	- **Balancing Act:**
	    - Striking the right balance between data granularity and performance is crucial.
	- **User Education:**
		- Educating end-users about the impact of data volume on performance and promoting best practices for efficient querying fosters a collaborative approach to performance optimization.
	- **Continuous Improvement:**
	    - Performance optimization is an ongoing process. 
	    - Regularly revisiting and refining optimization strategies based on changing data patterns and business requirements is essential for sustained performance gains.
